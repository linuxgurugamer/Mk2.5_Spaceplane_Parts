			a slight vertical misalignment
1.5.1
	Converted all TGA and PNG files to DDS. Note that there are a few png
	files which have a zero length, those are needed due to a quirk in the way
	the texture is read

		more efficient), are oriented sensibly, and pulled out such that a kerbal
		on a ladder does not slide (might be a smidge far out, though).
