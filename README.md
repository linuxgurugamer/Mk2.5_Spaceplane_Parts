# Mk2.5_Spaceplane_Parts

This is a parts pack of 2.5m spaceplane parts with a flat bottom, possessing a bit of aerodynamic lift.

The current masses of the tanks is set to a mostly-stock standard ratio of 
1/8 the mass of the fuel.

calculation based on the tank size.  The numbers in the patch are slightly
higher, but more realistic.
